* v1.0.1 by [@denpiligrim](https://github.com/denpiligrim) in [#3](https://github.com/denpiligrim/3dp-manager/pull/3)

**Full Changelog**: [v1.0...v1.0.1](https://github.com/denpiligrim/3dp-manager/compare/v1.0...v1.0.1)

Fixed:

- Installation failure when 3x-ui is missing or the URL cannot be determined, as well as when packages are missing.
- Docker installation. Now installed from the official Docker repository.
- The subscription token is now shorter and is generated without unnecessary dependencies.
- Error with interval setting (the interval was set to a maximum of one hour).
- Ports could be repeated, which prevented some inbound connections from being created.
- Fixed whitelist and reduced it to 100 domains.

Added:

- Support for Debian 12.11 and above
- Checking in Linux distribution scripts
- Opening ports on the main server if there is a firewall
- Instructions have been supplemented

⚠️ Important. If you had a problem with the interval, simply update the utility. If you were unable to install or encountered other critical issues, you will need to reinstall and possibly completely [remove](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#uninstall-docker-engine) Docker. It is recommended to install on a `clean` system.
